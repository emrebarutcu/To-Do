## 🔐 Security Implementation

### Firebase Security Rules
Comprehensive security rules ensure:
- **Data isolation**: Users can only access their own family's data
- **Role-based permissions**: Parents have full control, children have limited access
- **Task management**: Only parents can create/assign tasks, children can only mark completion
- **Reward system**: Parents manage rewards, children can only redeem
- **Authentication required**: All operations require valid authentication

### Key Security Features
- **Family-level isolation**: Each family's data is completely separate
- **Role verification**: All operations check user roles before allowing access
- **Child protection**: Children cannot access other families' data
- **Parent control**: Parents have full administrative control over their family
